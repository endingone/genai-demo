It also includes optional, integrated AI to extract more text and structure from raw content, and to chunk and vectorize content for vector search.\\nHow do I work with Azure AI Search?\\nThe primary workflow is create, load, and query an index. Although you can use the portal for most tasks, Azure AI Search is intended to be used programmatically, handling requests from client code. Programmatic support is provided through REST APIs and client libraries in .NET, Python, Java, and JavaScript SDKs for Azure.\\nAre \"Azure Search\" and \"Azure Cognitive Search\" and \"Azure AI Search\" the same product?\\nAzure Search was renamed to Azure Cognitive Search in October 2019 to reflect the expanded (yet optional) use of cognitive skills and AI processing in service operations. Azure Cognitive Search was renamed to Azure AI Search in October 2023 to align with Azure AI services.\\nWhat languages are supported?\\nThe default analyzer used for tokenization is standard Lucene and it is language agnostic. Otherwise, language support is expressed through language analyzers that apply linguistic rules to inbound (indexing) and outbound (queries) content.

Internally, inbound text is processed into tokens and stored in inverted indexes, and inbound vectors are stored in vector indexes. The document format that Azure AI Search can index is JSON. You can upload JSON documents that you've assembled, or use an indexer to retrieve and serialize your data into JSON.\\nAI enrichment through cognitive skills is an extension of indexing. If you have images or large unstructured text in source document, you can attach skills that perform OCR, describe images, infer structure, translate text and more. You can also attach skills that perform data chunking and vectorization.\\n· Querying can happen once an index is populated with searchable content, when your client app sends query requests to a search service and handles responses. All query execution is over a search index that you control.\\nSemantic ranking is an extension of query execution. It adds language understanding to search results processing, promoting the most semantically relevant results to the top.\\nWhy use Azure AI Search?\\nAzure AI Search is well suited for the following application scenarios:\\n. Search over your vector and text content, isolated from the internet.\\n· Consolidate heterogeneous content into a user-defined and populated search index composed of vectors and text.\\n· Integrate data chunking and vectorization for generative Al and RAG apps.\\n.

Indexing creates inverted indexes and other physical data structures that support information retrieval. It creates vector indexes if the schema includes vector fields.\\nCan I move, backup, and restore indexes?\\nThere's no native support for porting indexes. Search indexes are considered downstream data structures, accepting content from other data sources that collect operational data. As such, there's no built-in support for backing up and restoring indexes because the expectation is that you would rebuild an index from source data if you deleted it, or wanted to move it.\\nHowever, if you want to move an index between search services, you can try the index- backup-restore sample code in this Azure Al Search .NET sample repo [2. There's also a Python version of backup and restore [2 .\\nCan I restore my index or service once it's deleted?\\nNo, if you delete an Azure AI Search index or service, it can't be recovered. When you delete a search service, all indexes in the service are deleted permanently.\\nCan I index from SQL Database replicas?\\nIf you're using the search indexer for Azure SQL Database, there are no restrictions on the use of primary or secondary replicas as a data source when building an index from scratch. However, refreshing an index with incremental updates (based on changed records) requires the primary replica. This requirement comes from SQL Database, which guarantees change tracking on primary replicas only. If you try using secondary replicas for an index refresh workload, there's no guarantee you get all of the data.\\nVectors\\nWhat is vector search?\\nVector search is a technique that finds the most similar documents by comparing their vector representations. Since the goal of a vector representation is to capture the essential characteristics of an item in a numerical format, vector queries can identify similar content even if there are no explicit matches based on keywords or tags.

FAQ\\nGeneral\\nWhat is Azure AI Search?\\nAzure AI Search provides a dedicated search engine and persistent storage of your searchable content for full text and vector search scenarios. It also includes optional, integrated AI to extract more text and structure from raw content, and to chunk and vectorize content for vector search.\\nHow do I work with Azure AI Search?\\nThe primary workflow is create, load, and query an index. Although you can use the portal for most tasks, Azure AI Search is intended to be used programmatically, handling requests from client code. Programmatic support is provided through REST APIs and client libraries in .NET, Python, Java, and JavaScript SDKs for Azure.\\nAre \"Azure Search\" and \"Azure Cognitive Search\" and \"Azure AI Search\" the same product?\\nAzure Search was renamed to Azure Cognitive Search in October 2019 to reflect the expanded (yet optional) use of cognitive skills and AI processing in service operations. Azure Cognitive Search was renamed to Azure AI Search in October 2023 to align with Azure AI services.\\nWhat languages are supported?\\nThe default analyzer used for tokenization is standard Lucene and it is language agnostic. Otherwise, language support is expressed through language analyzers that apply linguistic rules to inbound (indexing) and outbound (queries) content. Some features, such as speller, are limited to a subset of languages.

            "Azure AI Search is a platform for secure information retrieval at scale over user-owned content, which can be used in a variety of search applications. It provides a search engine for full text and vector search over a search index and supports rich indexing, including data chunking and vectorization (currently in preview), lexical analysis for text, and optional AI enrichment for content extraction and transformation. The platform offers a rich query syntax for vector queries, text search, hybrid search, fuzzy search, autocomplete, geo-search, and others, all within the security and scale of Azure. It integrates with other Azure services at the data layer, machine learning layer, Azure AI services, and Azure OpenAI<sup><a href=\"https://blobstorage2znp775rdhyvo.blob.core.windows.net/techdocs/Azure_Cognitive_Search_Documentation_Overview.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2024-04-29T18:11:18Z&st=2024-03-17T10:11:18Z&spr=https&sig=qtSFdHgO4IxArZIDQZbvcc2T7Q4INFsy7XZiIjOqWE0%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",

The index-backup-restore sample code is available in the Azure AI Search .NET sample repository, and a Python version of backup and restore is also available. These tools can be used to manage indexes between search services<sup><a href=\"https://blobstorage2znp775rdhyvo.blob.core.windows.net/techdocs/Azure_Cognitive_Search_Documentation_Overview.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bfqt&srt=sco&sp=rwdlacupiytfx&se=2024-04-29T18:11:18Z&st=2024-03-17T10:11:18Z&spr=https&sig=qtSFdHgO4IxArZIDQZbvcc2T7Q4INFsy7XZiIjOqWE0%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
